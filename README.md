Hi!
This is my portfolio version 2.0 that was builded in Angular v4.x with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).
Fell free to study the code!

## Development server
Clone this repo, switch to the v.2 branch and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
